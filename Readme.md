# jQuery.isValid #
jQuery.isValid is a form validation plugin that includes multiple types of error checking, customisation of error messages and how/when they are shown. 

## Get Started ##
To use jQuery.isValid, make sure you have jQuery and then add the following markup to your html:

    <!-- Styles -->   
    <link type="text/css" href="css/jQuery.isValid.css" rel="stylesheet" />

    <!-- Scripts Unminified -->   
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/moment.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jQuery.isValid.js"></script>

    <!-- Scripts Minified -->   
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/moment.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jQuery.isValid.min.js"></script>

They can be found in the dist folder in the repository, both minified and unminified.

There is a dependency on moment.js and the checkPostCode is 1 function just split out ito a single file. Credit to John Gardner for this.

## How it works ##
Full documentation and explanations of how to use the plugin can be found here [jQuery.isValid Documentation](http://ajdrummer93.github.io/jquery.isValid/).

## Browser Support ##
Tested in:

- IE8 and above
- Firefox
- Chrome (Android and Desktop)
- Safari (iOS and Desktop)

It could well work in other browsers, but I just haven't tested in every single one.
